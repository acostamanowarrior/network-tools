network-tools
=============

`network-tools` is a collection of tools for debugging OpenShift cluster network issues.
It contains both debugging scripts (described in the next section) and useful tools to get
information from the cluster. This repo is supposed to be used by network engineers and 
support to debug and diagnose issues. Customers can also be advised to use commands from this 
image to help get required information.

## How to use

### Locally
To use network-tools locally, you can just clone this repo and run
`./debug-scripts/network-tools -h` - that will list all available commands.

You can also create a symlink for your convenience to just use `network-tools`
`ln -s <repo-path>/debug-scripts/network-tools /usr/bin/network-tools`
`network-tools -h`

### On the cluster

You can use almost all the same scripts on the cluster via network-tools image, to run one command you can use
`oc adm must-gather --image quay.io/openshift/origin-network-tools:latest -- network-tools -h`

WARNING! `must-gather` doesn't allow interactive input, don't use interactive options with must-gather.

For more examples and options check [user docs](https://github.com/openshift/network-tools/blob/master/docs/user.md)

## Debugging Scripts
Debugging scripts are kept in `debug-scripts`.  The content of that folder is placed in `/opt/bin` in the image.
Symlink is created for `/opt/bin/network-tools` to `/usr/bin/network-tools` that allows to just call `network-tools`.

`debug-scripts/local-scripts` folder contains scripts that shouldn't be run on the cluster via `oc adm must-gather`, they
are not copied to the image. But these scripts are available for local use (`network-tools -h` will list currently available commands).

`debug-scripts/network-tools` is a single entry point for all commands that were tested and properly documented. Not all scripts from
`debug-scripts` folder may be included to the `network-tools`. If you need to run such a script, call it directly via
`debug-scripts/<script path>` locally or `/opt/bin/<script path>` in the image.
